      <h1>Information on the Vienna Philharmonic Subscription Concerts</h1>
      <p>
        Since 1860, the Vienna Philharmonic Subscription Concerts have formed the basis of the orchestra's musical endeavors and have become an indispensable component of
        Viennese musical life. As a result, the demand for subscriptions is great and the waiting list is long. We explain to you here the procedure for obtaining a subscription
        to the Saturday, Sunday or Soirée series.
      </p>
      <h1>Ticket Information for Additional Vienna Philharmonic Concerts in Vienna and on Tour</h1>
      <p>
        Although the waiting line for subscription concerts appears very long, there are numerous other possibilities to experience the orchestra first-hand in Vienna, in
        Austria, within Europe and around the world. The Vienna Philharmonic performs many concerts in Vienna for the Society of Friends of Music, for the Vienna Festival
        Weeks and on other occasions. Every year the orchestra can be heard at the Salzburg Mozart Week as well as at the Salzburg Festival. In addition, the orchestra makes
        concert appearances in the most outstanding concert halls in Europe and abroad, including annual concert series in Japan and New York.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information regarding all Vienna Philharmonic concerts, both domestic and abroad, can be found on this website. However, because the majority of these concerts are
        presented by other organizations, these tickets are not sold over our website. Instead, you will find on the detail page for each concert a link to the information
        page of the particular concert presenter, assuming that this information is available to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Vienna State Opera should certainly also be mentioned in this context. Every year the musicians of the Vienna Philharmonic perform here on nearly 300 evenings
        in their capacity as the Vienna State Opera Orchestra. Ticket information for all performances at the Vienna State Opera can be found <a href="https://www.wiener-staatsoper.at/en/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h1>Tickets for the New Year's Concert</h1>
      <p>
        Due to extremely high demand, tickets for the three traditional end of year concerts of the Vienna Philharmonic are drawn by lot over the Vienna Philharmonic website at the beginning of each year.
        Detailed information about participation in the drawing can be found <a href="https://www.wienerphilharmoniker.at/en/newyearsconcert/ticket-information">here</a>. We have also published Frequently Asked Questions for more information. The only way to obtain tickets for these concerts
        is by taking part in the online drawing!
      </p>
      <h1>The Summer Night Concert in Schönbrunn</h1>
      <p>
        Every year the Vienna Philharmonic presents an open-air concert in the unique ambiance of the Schönbrunn Palace Gardens in Vienna. All Viennese and visitors to the city are invited to this event, which is open to the public free of charge. There are no tickets to be procured or reservations
        to be obtained for this concert. All pertinent information regarding this event can be found on the <a href="https://www.wienerphilharmoniker.at/en/summernightconcert">Summer Night Concert Schönbrunn pages</a>.
